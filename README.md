Super Kanji Bounce is an experimental educational game I made in UE5 for a competition. Most notably, I wrote almost all the code in C++, and I made a post process shader for it that includes a monochrome green palette, pixelation effect, dithering, and an outline effect which uses the stencil buffer to not outline certain materials.
	 As some background to the gameplay, Kanji is the Japanese word for Chinese character. Each Kanji is made up of smaller parts called Radicals. The idea was for users to gather images and match them with Kanji Radicals to help them memorize the Kanji. The competition had some strict rules to follow, so the gameplay may feel very hodge podge.
